    "# For each word in a sentence, we can define:\n",

    "# \n",
    "# Emission probabilities are calculated on the fly using a Poisson\n",
    "# distribution as follows:\n",
    "# P(observed word|intended word) = PMF of Poisson(k, l), where\n",

    "# Algorithm:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The spell-checking itself is carried out using a modified version\n",
    "# of the Viterbi algorithm, which yields the most likely sequence of\n",
    "# hidden states, i.e. the most likely sequence of words that form a\n",
    "# sentence. The main difference to the 'standard' Viterbi algorithm\n",
    "# is that the state space (i.e. the list of possible corrections) is\n",
    "# generated (and therefore varies) for each word. This is in contrast\n",
    "# to the alternative of considering the state space of all possible\n",
    "# words in the dictionary for every word that is checked, which would\n",
    "# be intractable for larger dictionaries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm is best illustrated by way of an example.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Suppose that we are checking the sentence 'This is ax test.'\n",
    "# The emissions for the entire sentence are 'This is ax test.' and\n",
    "# the hidden states for the entire sentence are 'This is a test.'\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As a pre-processing step, we convert everything to lowercase,\n",
    "# eliminate punctuation, and break the sentence up into a list of\n",
    "# words: ['this', 'is', 'ax', 'text']\n",
    "# This list is passed as a parameter to the viterbi function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm tackles each word in turn, starting with 'this'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We first use get_suggestions to obtain a list of all words that\n",
    "# may have been intended instead of 'this', i.e. all possible hidden\n",
    "# states (intended words) for the emission (word typed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely corrections:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['this']\n",
    "# - 3 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['his', 'thus', 'thin']\n",
    "# - 6 words with an edit distance of 2 \n",
    "#   ['the', 'that', 'is', 'him', 'they', 'their']\n",
    "# \n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space, i.e. possible words that\n",

    "# to the PMF of Poisson(edit distance, 0.01).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the list of possible corrections, we calculate:\n",
    "# P(word starting a sentence) * P(observed 'this'|intended word)\n",
    "# This is a simple application of Bayes' rule: by normalizing the\n",
    "# probabilities we obtain P(intended word|oberved 'this') for\n",
    "# each of the 10 words.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We store the word-probability pairs for future use, and move on to\n",

    "# - 9 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['in', 'it', 'his', 'as', 'i', 's', 'if', 'its', 'us']\n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space for the second word.\n",
    "#\n",

    "Various optimizations were attempted for this implementation, including modifications to partitioning and caching, as well as slight variations in the operations (e.g. replacing groupByKey with reduceByKey).  These changes all failed to yield significant improvements in performance; this is most likely due to the very simple nature of the algorithm, which only has one map operation related to the actual spell-checking.  The function correct_document_context_parallel_naive requires very minimal shuffling (~150KB shuffle reads and shuffles writes for 100 Yelp reviews), so there is little room for improvement in that respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting the overhead associated with the pre-processing, which is necessary to create the lookup tables that are used by the spell-checker. In particular, creating the transition matrix involves two relatively large shuffle reads and shuffle writes (~8.6MB and ~4.5MB) associated with the reduceByKey and groupByKey operations. The creation of the dictionary and start word probabilities is considerably less expensive (~1MB shuffles for each).\n",

    "### Notes on local & AWS performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial implementation consistently checks approximately 40 words per second. For smaller file sizes, this was clearly superior to the performance of the SPARK code, which was only able to check 4 words per second for 1 Yelp review, and 25 words per second for 10 Yelp reviews. However, the SPARK code began to outperform the serial code when moving to 100 Yelp reviews, achieving 61 words per second, and was able to reach 78 words per second when testing the file with 1,000 Yelp reviews. This file was the largest that could be run locally due to memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to AWS yielded further improvements. The smallest cluster tested (4 executors x 4 cores) was able to achieve 277 words per second on the same 1,000-review file - nearly 4 times the local speed. However, that particular cluster configuration would time out when attempting to run larger file sizes. We also experimented with different numbers of partitions on that cluster, and found that fewer partitions (16) performed slightly better than more partitions (64). Again, this is likely due to the simple nature of the implementation; increasing the number of partitions results in greater complexity without any offsetting gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step up was to move to a medium-size cluster (8 executors x 4 cores) and to increase the number of partitions accordingly to 64. This resulted in roughly a doubling in performance, with the same 1,000-review file being processed at 514 words per second. In addition, we were able to run the larger 10,000-review file, with even better performance of 585 words per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last configuration that we tested was a 16 executor x 4 core cluster. This configuration was clearly most appropriate for files at the larger end of the spectrum: while it only achieved a 1.6x improvement for the 1,000-review file, it ran 2x faster for the 10,000-review file (over 1,100 words per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "We had originally planned to test this implementation on even larger clusters with larger files, but were not able to do so due to the limit imposed by Amazon on the total number of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used m3.large instances for all of the above configurations, and upgraded the default AWS Python build to version 2.7 for consistency with our local development environment.\n",

    "## SPARK Implementation # 2 - Approximate Parallelization\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is inspired by the algorithm, but is not completely faithful to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given sentence, the Viterbi algorithm steps through each word in turn. At each iteration, it assesses the combination of all previous paths and the word currently under consideration, and only stores the previous path with the highest probability. Consequently, only a subset of the possible combinations of words are retained by the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, this implementation considers all the possible sentences that could be created through combinations of all possible corrections for all the words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \"This is a test\" -> if each word has 5 possible corrections, then there are 5^4 possible resulting sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the probability of each sentence (using the same concepts of start probabilities, emission probabilities, and transition probabilities) and choose the sentence (word combination) with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main problems with this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as expected, this approach yields similar corrections to the Viterbi algorithm in many cases, but not always. Despite not being a compeletely faithful representation of the original algorithm, this implementation was considered a way to experiment with a different way of parallelizing the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is more severe. Under this implementation, the size of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the text being checked (e.g. an 8-word sentence results in 10^8 possible combinations). This not only makes the approach inefficient, but (more importantly) means that it does not scale to larger problems.\n",

    "# distribution as follows:\n",

    "#\n",
    "# The spell-checking itself is carried out using a modified version\n",
    "# of the Viterbi algorithm, which yields the most likely sequence of\n",
    "# hidden states, i.e. the most likely sequence of words that form a\n",
    "# sentence. The main difference to the 'standard' Viterbi algorithm\n",
    "# is that the state space (i.e. the list of possible corrections) is\n",
    "# generated (and therefore varies) for each word. This is in contrast\n",
    "# to the alternative of considering the state space of all possible\n",
    "# words in the dictionary for every word that is checked, which would\n",
    "# be intractable for larger dictionaries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm is best illustrated by way of an example.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Suppose that we are checking the sentence 'This is ax test.'\n",
    "# The emissions for the entire sentence are 'This is ax test.' and\n",
    "# the hidden states for the entire sentence are 'This is a test.'\n",
    "#\n",
    "# As a pre-processing step, we convert everything to lowercase,\n",
    "# eliminate punctuation, and break the sentence up into a list of\n",
    "# words: ['this', 'is', 'ax', 'text']\n",
    "# This list is passed as a parameter to the viterbi function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The algorithm tackles each word in turn, starting with 'this'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We first use get_suggestions to obtain a list of all words that\n",
    "# may have been intended instead of 'this', i.e. all possible hidden\n",
    "# states (intended words) for the emission (word typed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# get_suggestions returns the 10 most likely corrections:\n",
    "# - 1 word with an edit distance of 0\n",
    "#   ['this']\n",
    "# - 3 words with an edit distance of 1\n",
    "#   ['his', 'thus', 'thin']\n",
    "# - 6 words with an edit distance of 2 \n",
    "#   ['the', 'that', 'is', 'him', 'they', 'their']\n",
    "# \n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space, i.e. possible words that\n",

    "#\n",
    "# For each word in the list of possible corrections, we calculate:\n",
    "# P(word starting a sentence) * P(observed 'this'|intended word)\n",
    "# This is a simple application of Bayes' rule: by normalizing the\n",
    "# probabilities we obtain P(intended word|oberved 'this') for\n",
    "# each of the 10 words.\n",

    "# We store the word-probability pairs for future use, and move on to\n",

    "#   ['in', 'it', 'his', 'as', 'i', 's', 'if', 'its', 'us']\n",
    "# These 10 words represent our state space for the second word.\n",

    "Unlike the previous implementation, the complexity of this approach meant that there was significant scope for optimization. By experimenting with various partitioning and caching strategies, we were able to materially increase the number of words checked per second. The motivation for the changes that were incorporated in the final version are included in-line with the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One noteworthy point is the memory complexity that is introduced by iterating through each word position for each sentence in parallel (i.e. each RDD element in this iteration is a single word, as opposed to a sentence is the first implementation). When first testing with larger file sizes, we found that this resulted in the code spawning more threads than could be handled by our local configurations. To alleviate this problem, we introduced an additional caching step of the \"completed\" sentences when exiting the loop. This increased the runtime for smaller files sizes, but meant that we were able to run larger file sizes locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all the improvements, the additional complexity of this implementation means that it remains slower overall for all file sizes compared to the naive parallelization approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous implementation, we found that a relatively small number of partitions (6) performed consistently well across file sizes.\n",

    "### Notes on local & AWS performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial implementation consistently checks approximately 40 words per second. For smaller file sizes, this was clearly superior to the performance of the SPARK code up to a file size of 100 Yelp reviews (33 words per second in SPARK). However, the SPARK code began to outperform the serial code when moving to larger file sizes, and was able to reach 47 words per second when testing the file with 500 Yelp reviews. This file was the largest that could be run locally due to memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to AWS yielded further improvements, though this implementation did not scale as well as the previous one. For example, the smallest cluster tested (4 executors x 4 cores) was able to achieve 110 words per second on the same 500-review file - just over 2 times the local speed (compared to the 4x speed-up for the first implementation). This improved only marginally to 115 words per second when moving to the 1,000-review file. However, it is interesting to note that increasing the number of partitions to 64 from 16 resulted in further improvements to 130 words per second. Unlike the first implementation, which performed best on this small cluster configuration with 16 partitions, the higher number of RDD elements required for this implementation is better suited to a higher number of partitions, especially when processing larger file sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to a medium-size cluster (8 executors x 4 cores) resulted in a ~1.7x improvement to 215 words per second, while the large cluster (16 executors x 4 cores) yielded a ~2.2x improvement to 289 words per second (both with respect to the small cluster on the 1,000-review file). This further confirms that this method does not scale to larger cluster sizes as effectively as the first SPARK implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we used m3.large instances for all of the above configurations, and upgraded the default AWS Python build to version 2.7 for consistency with the local development environment.\n",
